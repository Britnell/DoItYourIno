# Traffic light

This sketch will control an RGB-LED 
> LED with 3 internal LEDs in red, green and blue (R G B) 
> LEDs can be combine to produce many colours

This sketch uses a switch-case statement to create a single RGB() function that can be used to control the colour of the led

## Hardware
This sketch requires an RGB-LED. At Fablab-Rwanda we produced a small module with a 5V RGB-LED which can be connected to Arduino on any 3 digital pins.

###Functions
* switch() - case :
* [Arduino Reference]( https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/ )

1. Try adding more cases to the switch-case statement to create all the colors
2. You can fill in your functions 
> Every case statement should look like this 
> 	case 'letter':
>	 code lines...
>	 break;
